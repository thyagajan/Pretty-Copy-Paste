# Pretty-Copy-Paste
A windows utility to print the pretty JSON using only windows keys. 

Tired of copying the unformatted JSON, using an online converter/editor specific plugin to beautify it? You have landed at the right place.

**How about using just a combination of keys in any of the application or editor in windows to perform the same operation.?**

_Lets say you want to copy the JSON from one of your DB column and paste the formatted JSON in notepad++ or some other editor._

`All you need to do is, `

`instead of "ctrl+c", press "ctrl+windows+c" to copy the JSON and paste as usual in your favorite editor.`

There are some scenarios, you might be copying from different platform where windows keys doesn't work and only right click copy or editor based copy is allowed. In those scenarios, 

`copy as usual and while pasting instead of "ctrl+v" press "ctrl+windows+v", your json will be pasted pretty!!!`

Very simple isn't it?
